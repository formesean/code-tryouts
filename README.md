# Tryout Problem Submission Guide

Thank you for participating in the tryout. Please follow these instructions to format and submit your solutions.

## Submission Format

1. **Organize Each Item**:

   - Create a separate folder for each problem item (e.g., `Item 1`, `Item 2`, etc.).
   - Inside each folder, save your solution file with the default naming convention for the respective language:
     - **C**: `main.c`
     - **C++**: `main.cpp`
     - **Java**: `Main.java`
     - **Python**: `main.py`

2. **Zip File**:

   - After organizing your solutions, compress the folders into a single `.zip` file.
   - Name the zip file as follows: `<YourFamilyName>_<ProgrammingLanguage>.zip`
   - Example: `Aguilar_Python.zip`

3. **Upload Your Submission**:
   - Submit the `.zip` file using the link provided below:
